# Klein wireframe kit (HTML, CSS) Template

Klein wireframe kit is a HTML Template for developing fast and powerful web interfaces.

### Getting Started

First of all I want to thanks [Mr. Bertold Lakner](https://www.behance.net/labert) to design this amazing wireframe kit. You can download Adobe XD file from [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/61383543/Klein-wireframe-kit-for-Adobe-XD-Free).

Currently I am learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Basically I am interested in Front-end development.
Klein Wireframe Kit is my first project on GitHub as well as this is my first HTML, CSS project. This project include different types of forms, menu, headers, and articles.

***To execute this project just open index.html file in the browser.***
